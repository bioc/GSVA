	abstract = {Understanding the cell-cell interactions that control {CNS} development and function has long been limited by the lack of methods to cleanly separate neural cell types. Here we describe methods for the prospective isolation and purification of astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes from developing and mature mouse forebrain. We used {FACS} (fluorescent-activated cell sorting) to isolate astrocytes from transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein {(EGFP)} under the control of an S100beta promoter. Using Affymetrix {GeneChip} Arrays, we then created a transcriptome database of the expression levels of {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater20,000 genes by gene profiling these three main {CNS} neural cell types at various postnatal ages between postnatal day 1 {(P1)} and P30. This database provides a detailed global characterization and comparison of the genes expressed by acutely isolated astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. We found that {Aldh1L1} is a highly specific antigenic marker for astrocytes with a substantially broader pattern of astrocyte expression than the traditional astrocyte marker {GFAP.} Astrocytes were enriched in specific metabolic and lipid synthetic pathways, as well as the {draper/Megf10} and Mertk/integrin alphavbeta5 phagocytic pathways suggesting that astrocytes are professional phagocytes. Our findings call into question the concept of a "glial" cell class as the gene profiles of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes are as dissimilar to each other as they are to neurons. This transcriptome database of acutely isolated purified astrocytes, neurons, and oligodendrocytes provides a resource to the neuroscience community by providing improved cell-type-specific markers and for better understanding of neural development, function, and disease.},

Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by {PGC-1alpha} and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity.

We demonstrate how {GSEA} yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer.

	Abstract = {Learning of large-scale networks of interactions from microarray data is an important and challenging problem in bioinformatics. A widely used approach is to assume that the available data constitute a random sample from a multivariate distribution belonging to a Gaussian graphical model. As a consequence, the prime objects of inference are full-order partial correlations which are partial correlations between two variables given the remaining ones. In the context of microarray data the number of variables exceed the sample size and this precludes the application of traditional structure learning procedures because a sampling version of full-order partial correlations does not exist. In this paper we consider limited-order partial correlations, these are partial correlations computed on marginal distributions of manageable size, and provide a set of rules that allow one to assess the usefulness of these quantities to derive the independence structure of the underlying Gaussian graphical model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel structure learning procedure based on a quantity, obtained from limited-order partial correlations, that we call the non-rejection rate. The applicability and usefulness of the procedure are demonstrated by both simulated and real data.},

@article{Castelo_qpgraph_2009,
	Abstract = {Reverse engineering bioinformatic procedures applied to high-throughput experimental data have become instrumental in generating new hypotheses about molecular regulatory mechanisms. This has been particularly the case for gene expression microarray data, where a large number of statistical and computational methodologies have been developed in order to assist in building network models of transcriptional regulation. A major challenge faced by every different procedure is that the number of available samples n for estimating the network model is much smaller than the number of genes p forming the system under study. This compromises many of the assumptions on which the statistics of the methods rely, often leading to unstable performance figures. In this work, we apply a recently developed novel methodology based in the so-called q-order limited partial correlation graphs, qp-graphs, which is specifically tailored towards molecular network discovery from microarray expression data with p >> n. Using experimental and functional annotation data from Escherichia coli, here we show how qp-graphs yield more stable performance figures than other state-of-the-art methods when the ratio of genes to experiments exceeds one order of magnitude. More importantly, we also show that the better performance of the qp-graph method on such a gene-to-sample ratio has a decisive impact on the functional coherence of the reverse-engineered transcriptional regulatory modules and becomes crucial in such a challenging situation in order to enable the discovery of a network of reasonable confidence that includes a substantial number of genes relevant to the essayed conditions. An R package, called qpgraph implementing this method is part of the Bioconductor project and can be downloaded from (www.bioconductor.org). A parallel standalone version for the most computationally expensive calculations is available from (http://functionalgenomics.upf.xsedu/qpgraph).},

	Abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

On isoelectric focusing abnormal patterns of beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase and beta-glucuronidase activities were commonly found in myeloid and non-T, non-B cell leukaemias. All patients with acute myeloid leukaemia exhibited a relative decrease in the B form of beta-hexosaminidase activity.

Expression of the {RARα1} isoform is also significantly reduced in primary {AML} cells, but not in {AML} cell lines. Although the promoters directing expression of {RARα1} and {RARα2} are respectively unmethylated and methylated in {AML} cell lines, these regulatory regions are unmethylated in all the {AML} patient cell samples analyzed. Moreover, in primary {AML} cells, histones associated with the {RARα2} promoter possessed diminished levels of H3 acetylation and lysine 4 methylation.

We investigated the association between polymorphisms in key folate metabolism enzymes {(MTHFR} 677 {C{\textbackslash}textgreaterT}, {MTHFR} 1298 {A{\textbackslash}textgreaterC}, {SHMT1} 1420 {C{\textbackslash}textgreaterT}, {MTR} 2756 {A{\textbackslash}textgreaterG}, {TS} 1494del6, and {TS} 28bp repeat) in 939 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia {(ALL)} and 89 cases of acute myeloid leukemia {(AML)} recruited into the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study. We also examined the maternal genotypes of 752 of these cases. Data from 824 noncancer controls recruited were used for comparison. No evidence of an association with {MTHFR} 677 was observed for {ALL} or {AML}, either in children or their mothers. However, in children an increased risk of {ALL} (odds ratio {[OR]} = 1.88; 95\% confidence interval {[CI]}, 1.16-3.07; P = .010) and {AML} {(OR} = 2.74; 95\% {CI}, 1.07-7.01; P = .036) was observed with the {MTR} 2756 {GG} genotype; the association was most pronounced for cases with the {MLL} translocation {(OR} = 4.90; 95\% {CI}, 1.30-18.45; P = .019). These data suggest that genetic variation in methionine synthase could mediate risk of childhood leukemia, either via effects on {DNA} methylation or via effects on fetal growth and development.},
